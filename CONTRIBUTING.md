# Thank you for contributing

If you have any ideas for the project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ChrisCavs/aimless.js/issues).  I monitor issues frequently and it is a great place for active discussion on new features, refactors, etc.  Even if your idea is half-baked, it may well be worth opening an issue and starting a discussion!

If you'd like, you can also open a [pull request](https://github.com/ChrisCavs/aimless.js/pulls). I am happy to review your code or branch off of it. However, please note that I am unlikely to merge code directly into aimless.js due to code quality / copywrite concerns.  If you're just tooling around with an idea, an [issue](https://github.com/ChrisCavs/aimless.js/issues) might have more success.
